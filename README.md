# Web Development Portfolio

```
This site was created as a portfolio containing all of the projects that I've worked on in order to demonstrate my skills and experience. My first project, an html/css project, was the Run Buddy website--which is featured as the highlighted project with a larger presence on the page. There are placeholders occupying the page to house later projects, which will be added as they're completed. In the near future the site will undergo some re-design and include a link to my professional resume.
